This section is reserved for all of the files relating to the AI components of the project. 

For example, the base code for creating, running, and adjusting the neural network, 
relevant activation and loss functions (plus some extra),
all text files which includes the data for the weights and biases for the various ai models used (essentially the brains for the AI),
perhaps some models of different sizes as I will be testing at least two different training approaches.
